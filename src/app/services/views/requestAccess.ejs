                As an end user, you must request access to a service in order to use that service through your account.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                Here's how to request access to a service:
            </p>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Go to 'services'.</li>
                <li>Select 'request access to a service' from the 'related actions' list.</li>
                <li>Select the service you'd like to access.</li>
                <li>Select the relevant sub-service or role (if applicable).</li>

        <p class="govuk-body">
            This is dependent upon your approver. However, we would expect a request to be approved (or rejected) within
            5 days of it being raised.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you are having trouble with an approver not dealing with your requests, please <a class="govuk-link-bold"

        <h3 id="who-receives-request" class="govuk-heading-m">Who receives my request?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Your request will be received by all approvers at the relevant organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            It will not be sent to the Department for Education.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            An approver is someone with administration rights, responsible for managing users and dealing with requests.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            The number of approvers at an organisation will vary. You can see how many approvers your organisation has
            under 'organisations' in the navigation.
        </p>

        <h3 id="chase-up-outstanding-request" class="govuk-heading-m">Can I chase up an outstanding request?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Most requests will be approved or rejected within 5 days of being raised, and we recommend waiting the full
            duration before taking action.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you have waited the full 5 days and your request has still not been dealt with, please try the following.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Navigate to 'organisations', find the email address of an approver at the relevant organisation, and send a
            chaser email.
