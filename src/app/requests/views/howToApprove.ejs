        <p class="govuk-body">
            To approve a request, follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Go to 'requests'.</li>
            <li>Select the request you would like to approve or review.</li>
            <li>Read the request review page carefully.</li>
            <li>If you are confident the request should be approved, select 'approve'.</li>
            <li>The user will receive an email informing them of their approval.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What should I check before approving a request?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            As an approver, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person who raised a request is eligible for the access 
            they’ve requested.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Best practice is to check:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>that the user is who they claim to be</li>
            <li>that the user has a valid reason for their request</li>
            <li>that there are no security concerns around giving the user access</li>
        </ul>
