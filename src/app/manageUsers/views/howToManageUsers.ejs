                How do I manage users as an approver?
            </h2>

                As an approver, you can manage the users at your organisation by selecting ‘manage users’ from the navigation bar at the top of the screen.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
                On the manage users page you will see all users for all the organisations to which you are assigned. You can also perform several actions.
