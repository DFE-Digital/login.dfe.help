                Setting up your account is a three-stage process. Here’s what you need to do to complete your set up.

        <h3 id="verify-account" class="govuk-heading-m">Verify your account</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You will likely have completed this step as part of first creating your DfE Sign-in account.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            In this step you will need to verify your email address and set a password for your account.
        </p>

        <h3 id="connect-organisation" class="govuk-heading-m">Connect to an organisation</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            To use DfE Sign-in, and the services hosted within, you will need to associate your account with an organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            This organisation must be one with which you have an established relationship, such as being an employee or teacher.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You will be asked to connect with ONE organisation as part of setting up your account. You can add other 
            organisations once set-up is complete.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you are a multi-academy trust user, please use the main organisation to which you have an established relationship.
        </p>

        <h3 id="access-to-organisations" class="govuk-heading-m">How to request access to an organisation during set up</h3>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Go to 'services'.</li>
            <li>Select the button to the right of 'request access to an organisation'.</li>
            <li>Search for your organisation by name, URN, or UKPRN.</li>
            <li>Select your organisation from the list.</li>
            <li>Provide a comment explaining why you need access to this organisation (this will be seen by approvers at that 
                organisation) then select ‘confirm’.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Once you’ve made a request to access an organisation, it will be dealt with by approvers at that organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Generally, a request should be responded to within 5 days.
        </p>

        <h3 id="acces-to-services" class="govuk-heading-m">Get access to services</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Services are areas within DfE Sign-in that allow you to complete a specific task or see certain data. Examples include; 
            Get Information About Schools (GIAS), Analyse School Performance, and Publish to the Course Directory.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            To use a service, you will first need to get access to it. To do this, you will need to request access from an approver.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Please email a known approver at your organisation to request access to a service. If you do not know which services 
            you need, mention your job role as this will help your approver select services on your behalf.
