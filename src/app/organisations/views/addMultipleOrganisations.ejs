        <h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Can I add multiple organisations to my account?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            You can. One account is all you need to manage every organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            However, you will need to request access to additional organisations to get them associated with your account.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How to get additional organisations on your account</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If you need more than one organisation to be associated with your account (such as if you work at a multi-academy trust), follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
            <li>Go to 'organisations'.</li>
            <li>Select 'request an organisation' from the related actions.</li>
            <li>Search for your organisation by name, URN, or UKPRN.</li>
            <li>Select your organisation from the list.</li>
            <li>Provide a comment explaining why you need access to this organisation (this will be seen by approvers at that organisation) then select ‘confirm’.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Once you’ve made a request to access an organisation, it will be dealt with by approvers at that organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            Generally, a request should be responded to within 5 days.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How do I chase up an outstanding organisation request?</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            If your organisation request hasn’t been responded to within 5 days, it will automatically be escalated to our team. We will then attempt to resolve the issue as quickly as we can.
        </p>
        <p class="govuk-body">
            To chase up a request manually, it may be best to contact senior members of the organisation in question.
        </p>
